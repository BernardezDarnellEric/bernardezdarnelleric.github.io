                    <p>In the evolution of Baguio City’s food scene, the Japanese cuisine must have been the type of dish that played a love-hate relationship with the City of Pines. I say this because during the early 2000 there were a proliferation of Japanese restaurants in the City. Have you heard of Rai-rai ken? Shikki and its three branches in Baguio? If not then you may have missed the first rise of Japanese cuisine in Baguio. Sadly, these Japanese restaurants closed down, maybe due to the fact that they were not able to capture that generations’ taste. I was among the few who got disappointed when these Japanese restaurants closed because I honestly love their food.</p>
                    <p>Fast forward to today, it looks like there is a resurgence of Japanese restaurants serving authentic Japanese dishes. One evidence if the opening of new japanese restaurants in Baguio City. One particular Japanese restaurant that caught our attention is Shoriken at Mines View. The reason why it caught our attention is because of the fact that they have a Japanese buffet type of set-up on weekends. Imagine, having to taste all your favorite Japanese dishes!</p>

                    <p>One of the most sought after “pasalubong” in Baguio City is the Raisin Bread. The popularity of this yummy moist club-shaped bread smothered with cinnamon and raisin captured the taste of not only the tourists in Baguio but residents as well. We sometimes take the time to go to the store where this bread is being sold just to satisfy our cravings.</p>
                    <p>After having eaten merienda (snack/ tea time) buffet at a popular hotel-restaurant in Baguio City we decided to take a look at the “ginger bread” house adjacent to the hotel (well I just called it that, not really sure what it’s called). Anyway, since we want to bring home some pastries be bought a “club” of raisin bread. My expectations isn’t much since it doesn’t have any fancy cover or anything, just raisin bread wrapped in plastic.</p>
